Data files should be placed in your R working directory for coding to run properly. Output will be "summary.txt"

- activity_labels.txt
- features.txt
- subject_test.txt
- subject_train.txt
- X_test.txt
- X_train.txt
- y_test.txt
- y_train.txt

The purpose of the coding is to take the mean and standard deveation pre-processed data from above and provide a mean summary by participant and activity. Summary data is provided in a "wide" format.
